# MonsterLegendsSigningTool
This tool signs the messages that are used in the "Monster Legends" facebook game.

 - [The tool is available online here](https://ash47.github.io/MonsterLegendsSigningTool/release/)
 - The tool requires flash to perform the signing
 - Input a string into the input box and then press sign
 - A signed message will be displayed directly below that
 - The signed message is a salted SHA-256 hash (or more specifically, a HMAC)
 - Source code fully available in the repo, the source code is reverse engineered, and hence, VERY UGLY, but, it does work :)
